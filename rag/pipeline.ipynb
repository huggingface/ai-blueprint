The relevance of these advances was overhyped at times, says ex-DeepMinder Edward Grefenstette, who now works in the Facebook AI Research group as a research scientist. \"The field has come a very long way in the past decade, but we are very much aware that we still have far to go in scientific and technological advances to make machines truly intelligent,\" he said. \"One of the biggest challenges is to develop methods that are much more efficient in terms of the data and compute power required to learn to solve a problem well. In the past decade, we\\'ve seen impressive advances made by increasing the scale of data and computation available, but that\\'s not appropriate or scalable for every problem. \"If we want to scale to more complex behaviour, we need to do better with less data, and we need to generalise more. \"\\nNeil Lawrence, who recently left Amazon and joined the University of Cambridge as the first DeepMind-funded professor of machine learning, thinks that the AI industry is very much still in the \"wonder years\".

But those conversations were taken less and less seriously as the decade went on. At the end of 2019, the smartest computers could still only excel at a \"narrow\" selection of tasks. Gary Marcus, an AI researcher at New York University, said: \"By the end of the decade there was a growing realisation that current techniques can only carry us so far. \"\\nHe thinks the industry needs some \"real innovation\" to go further. \"There is a general feeling of plateau,\" said Verena Rieser, a professor in conversational AI at Edinburgh\\'s Heriot Watt University. One AI researcher who wishes to remain anonymous said we\\'re entering a period where we are especially sceptical about AGI. \"The public perception of AI is increasingly dark: the public believes AI is a sinister technology,\" they said. For its part, DeepMind has a more optimistic view of AI\\'s potential, suggesting that as yet \"we\\'re only just scratching the surface of what might be possible\". \"As the community solves and discovers more, further challenging problems open up,\" explained Koray Kavukcuoglu, its vice president of research.', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51064369', 0.37062448263168335, 0.49980705976486206], ['Singularity: The robots are coming to steal our jobs\\n- 13 January 2014\\n- From the section Technology\\nIf you worry that the robots are coming, don\\'t, because they are already here.

The 10s were arguably the hottest AI summer on record with tech giants repeatedly touting AI\\'s abilities. AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio, sometimes called one of the \"godfathers of AI\", told the BBC that AI\\'s abilities were somewhat overhyped in the 10s by certain companies with an interest in doing so. There are signs, however, that the hype might be about to start cooling off. \"I have the sense that AI is transitioning to a new phase,\" said Katja Hofmann, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge. Given the billions being invested in AI and the fact that there are likely to be more breakthroughs ahead, some researchers believe it would be wrong to call this new phase an AI winter.
