    "Retrieval are quick estimates of the most relevant documents to a query which works fine for a first pass over millions of documents, but we can improve this relevance by reranking the retrieved documents. We will be using the retrieval microservice of the [Index and retrieve documents for vector search using Sentence Transformers and DuckDB](./retrieve.ipynb) notebook to build a reranker. We have seen how to index the Hugging Face Hub and perform vector search on it. Now, we will build a reranker that takes a set of documents and a query and returns a list of documents sorted by relevance to the query.\n",
