It is highly likely that malicious actors will use AI to attack the UK in numerous ways, and the intelligence community will need to develop new AI-based defence measures,\" argues Alexander Babuta, one of the authors.\\nThe independent report was commissioned by the UK\\'s GCHQ security service, and had access to much of the country\\'s intelligence community.\\nAll three of the UK\\'s intelligence agencies have made the use of technology and data a priority for the future - and the new head of MI5, Ken McCallum, who takes over this week, has said one of his priorities will be to make greater use of technology, including machine learning.\\nHowever, the authors believe that AI will be of only \"limited value\" in \"predictive intelligence\" in fields such as counter-terrorism.\\nThe often-cited fictional reference is the film Minority Report where technology is used to predict those on the path to commit a crime before they have carried it out.\\nBut the report argues this is less likely to be viable in real-life national security situations.\\nActs such as terrorism are too infrequent to provide sufficiently large historical datasets to look for patterns - they happen far less often than other criminal acts, such as burglary.\\nEven within that data set, the background and ideologies of the perpetrators vary so much that it is hard to build a model of a terrorist profile. There are too many variables to make prediction straightforward, with new events potentially being radically different from previous ones, the report argues.\\nAny kind of profiling could also be discriminatory and lead to new human-rights concerns.\\nIn practice, in fields like counter-terrorism, the report argues that \"augmented\" - rather than artificial - intelligence will be the norm - where technology helps human analysts sift through and prioritise increasingly large amounts of data, allowing humans to make their own judgements.\\nIt will be essential to ensure human operators remain accountable for decisions and that AI does not act as a \"black box\", from which people do not understand the basis on which decisions are made, the report says.\\nBit by bit\\nThe authors are also wary of some of the hype around AI, and of talk that it will soon be transformative.\\nInstead, they believe we will see the incremental augmentation of existing processes rather than the arrival of novel futuristic capabilities.\\nThey believe the UK is in a strong position globally to take a lead, with a concentration of capability in GCHQ - and more widely in the private sector, and in bodies like the Alan Turing Institute and the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation.\\nThis has the potential to allow the UK to position itself at the leading edge of AI use but within a clear framework of ethics, they say.\\nThe deployment of AI by intelligence agencies may require new guidance to ensure safeguards are in place and that any intrusion into privacy is necessary and proportionate, the report says.\\nRead more from Gordon:\\nOne of the thorny legal and ethical questions for spy agencies, especially since the Edward Snowden revelations, is how justifiable it is to collect large amounts of data from ordinary people in order to sift it and analyse it to look for those who might be involved in terrorism or other criminal activity.\\nAnd there\\'s the related question of how far privacy is violated when data is collected and analysed by a machine versus when a human sees it.\\nPrivacy advocates fear that artificial intelligence will require collecting and analysing far larger amounts of data from ordinary people, in order to understand and search for patterns, that create a new level of intrusion. The authors of the report believe new rules will be needed.\\nBut overall, they say it will be important not to become over-occupied with the potential downsides of the use of technology.\\n\"There is a risk of stifling innovation if we become overly-focused on hypothetical worst-case outcomes and speculations over some dystopian future AI-driven surveillance network,\" argues Mr Babuta.\\n\"Legitimate ethical concerns will be overshadowed unless we focus on likely and realistic uses of AI in the short-to-medium term.\"',\n",

It predicts a world where machines are firmly in control.\\nBut those conversations were taken less and less seriously as the decade went on. At the end of 2019, the smartest computers could still only excel at a \"narrow\" selection of tasks.\\nGary Marcus, an AI researcher at New York University, said: \"By the end of the decade there was a growing realisation that current techniques can only carry us so far.\"\\nHe thinks the industry needs some \"real innovation\" to go further.\\n\"There is a general feeling of plateau,\" said Verena Rieser, a professor in conversational AI at Edinburgh\\'s Heriot Watt University.\\nOne AI researcher who wishes to remain anonymous said we\\'re entering a period where we are especially sceptical about AGI.\\n\"The public perception of AI is increasingly dark: the public believes AI is a sinister technology,\" they said.\\nFor its part, DeepMind has a more optimistic view of AI\\'s potential, suggesting that as yet \"we\\'re only just scratching the surface of what might be possible\".\\n\"As the community solves and discovers more, further challenging problems open up,\" explained Koray Kavukcuoglu, its vice president of research.\\n\"This is why AI is a long-term scientific research journey.\\n\"We believe AI will be one of the most powerful enabling technologies ever created - a single invention that could unlock solutions to thousands of problems. The next decade will see renewed efforts to generalise the capabilities of AI systems to help achieve that potential - both building on methods that have already been successful and researching how to build general-purpose AI that can tackle a wide range of tasks.\"\\n\\'Far to go\\'\\nWhile AGI isn\\'t going to be created any time soon, machines have learned how to master complex tasks like:\\n- playing the ancient Chinese board game Go\\n- identifying human faces\\n- translating text into practically every language\\n- spotting tumours\\n- driving cars\\n- identifying animals.\\nThe relevance of these advances was overhyped at times, says ex-DeepMinder Edward Grefenstette, who now works in the Facebook AI Research group as a research scientist.\\n\"The field has come a very long way in the past decade, but we are very much aware that we still have far to go in scientific and technological advances to make machines truly intelligent,\" he said.\\n\"One of the biggest challenges is to develop methods that are much more efficient in terms of the data and compute power required to learn to solve a problem well. In the past decade, we\\'ve seen impressive advances made by increasing the scale of data and computation available, but that\\'s not appropriate or scalable for every problem.\\n\"If we want to scale to more complex behaviour, we need to do better with less data, and we need to generalise more.\"\\nNeil Lawrence, who recently left Amazon and joined the University of Cambridge as the first DeepMind-funded professor of machine learning, thinks that the AI industry is very much still in the \"wonder years\".\\nSo what will AI look like at the end of the 20s, and how will researchers go about developing it?\\n\"In the next decade, I hope we\\'ll see a more measured, realistic view of AI\\'s capability, rather than the hype we\\'ve seen so far,\" said Catherine Breslin, an ex-Amazon AI researcher.\\nThe term \"AI\" became a real buzzword through the last decade, with companies of all shapes and sizes latching onto the term, often for marketing purposes.\\n\"The manifold of things which were lumped into the term \"AI\" will be recognised and discussed separately,\" said Samim Winiger, a former AI researcher at Google in Berlin.\\n\"What we called \\'AI\\' or \\'machine learning\\' during the past 10-20 years, will be seen as just yet another form of \\'computation\\'\".',\n",

He is so worried about the onslaught of artificial intelligence that he has written a book about it.\\nOur Final Invention examines whether the increasing domination of artificial intelligence is going to mean the end of the human era.\\n\"Advanced AI is a dual-use technology, like nuclear fission. Fission can illuminate cities or incinerate them. At advanced levels, AI will be even more volatile and dangerous than fission, and it\\'s already being weaponised in autonomous drones and battlefield robots,\" Barrat told the BBC.\\n\"More than any other science it forces us to probe ourselves - what are these things we call intelligence, conscience, emotion?

Our innovation always runs far ahead of our stewardship,\" he said.\\nThe robot revolution may be some way off if a competition organised by the Pentagon\\'s research unit Darpa in December is anything to go by.\\nVideos posted online showed the robots remained much slower than humans, often unsteady on their feet with some failing to complete any of the challenges.\\nNonetheless there is a buzz around robots and artificial intelligence at the moment. Google has just bought eight robotic firms, while Facebook has its very own AI lab.\\nSpeculation is rife about what Google will do with its new acquisition.\\nGoogle robots could be very powerful, thinks Mr Barrat.\\n\"That\\'s one route to human level intelligence. A high quality personal assistant wouldn\\'t be just a smartphone - it\\'d have a humanoid body. Why humanoid? So it can drive your car, use your tools, bounce the baby, act as your bodyguard if need be,\" he said.\\nIf the rise of the robots is inevitable - albeit a few years off - then it is also a logical step that humans will eventually be eliminated from the decision chain entirely, meaning AIs will be controlling other AIs.\\nThat was already happening in our laptops and computers, said Mr Jacobstein.\\n\"Anti-virus software is basically AI techniques that is being used to detect other AIs that we call viruses and worms,\" he said.\\nBut he acknowledges that controls to make sure that the phrase \"robot failure\" doesn\\'t replace \"human failure\" would have to be built into future AI systems.\\n\"We would build the same layered control system we need in everyday life with humans. We want to look at the risks and build controls that stops that rogue behaviour,\" he said.\\nWhile Mr Jacobstein remains sanguine about the robot takeover, he is well aware that many see it as the stuff of nightmares.\\n\"Some people ask, \\'How do you sleep at night knowing the prospects for artificial intelligence?\\' but it isn\\'t artificial intelligence that keeps me awake at night, it is human stupidity,\" he said.\\nFor him, the only way that humans will keep up with the robots is to become more like them.\\n\"Our brains haven\\'t had a major upgrade for 50,000 years and if your laptop or smartphone hadn\\'t had an upgrade in five years you might be concerned about that,\" he said.\\nAlready we have access to AI\\'s such as Siri and Google Now and are pretty much constantly connected to the web via our smartphones, so it isn\\'t so much of a step to imagine a future where silicon is embedded in our skulls.\\nAnd it could be the only way for us to keep up with the robots.',\n",
