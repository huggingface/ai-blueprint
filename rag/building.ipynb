Now, we will build a RAG pipeline that uses this vector search index to retrieve relevant information from a company's documents and uses a SmolLM model to answer questions. Also, we will show how to use rerankers to improve the quality of the RAG pipeline.\n",

Here are some of the key trends and advancements that will shape the future of AI:\\n\\n1. **Quantum Computing**: Quantum computers are expected to revolutionize AI by solving complex problems that are currently unsolvable by classical computers. They will also enable AI to learn from itself, making it more self-aware and capable of adapting to new situations.\\n\\n2. **Neuromorphic Computing**: Neuromorphic computing is a type of AI that mimics the human brain's structure and function. It's expected to be used in AI systems that can learn and adapt in real-time, much like the human brain.\\n\\n3. **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Explainable AI aims to make AI systems more transparent and understandable. This is important because AI systems are often used in critical applications, and it's crucial that they are transparent about their decisions.\\n\\n4. **AI in Healthcare**: AI is being used in healthcare to improve diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. For example, AI can be used to analyze medical images, detect diseases, and provide personalized treatment recommendations.\\n\\n5. **AI in Education**: AI is being used in education to make learning more interactive, personalized, and effective. AI can help students learn more efficiently, and AI can also help teachers provide more effective feedback.\\n\\n6. **AI in Transportation**: AI is being used in transportation to improve safety, efficiency, and sustainability. For example, AI can be used to optimize traffic flow, predict traffic jams, and detect potential accidents.\\n\\n7. **AI in Agriculture**: AI is being used in agriculture to improve crop yields, predict weather patterns, and detect diseases. AI can also be used to optimize farming practices, such as irrigation and pest control.\\n\\n8. **AI in Virtual Reality**: AI is being used in virtual reality to create more immersive and realistic experiences. For example, AI can be used to create virtual environments that are more realistic than real-world environments.\\n\\n9. **AI in Robotics**: AI is being used in robotics to improve the performance of robots. For example, AI can be used to improve the navigation of robots, detect obstacles, and perform tasks that are currently difficult for robots.\\n\\n10. **AI in Social Media**: AI is being used in social media to improve the quality of content, detect spam, and provide personalized recommendations. AI can also be used to analyze social media data to understand public opinion and sentiment.\\n\\nThese are just a few of the trends and advancements that will shape the future of AI. The field is constantly evolving, and we're on the cusp of new breakthroughs and innovations.\"}]}]"
