# AI blueprint

A blueprint for AI development, focusing on applied examples of RAG, information extraction, analysis and fine-tuning in the age of LLMs. It is a more practical approach that strives to show the application of some of the theoretical learnings from [the smol-course](https://github.com/huggingface/smol-course) as an end2end real-world problem.

> ðŸš€ Web apps and microservices included!
>
> Each notebook will show how to deploy your AI as a [webapp on Hugging Face Spaces with Gradio](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-sdks-gradio), which you can directly use as microservices through [the Gradio Python Client](https://www.gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-python-client). All the code and demos can be used in a private or public setting. [Deployed on the Hub!](https://huggingface.co/ai-blueprint)

## The blueprint

We want to build a tool that can help us use AI on company documents. In our case, we will be working with the [ai-blueprint/fineweb-bbc-news](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai-blueprint/fineweb-bbc-news) dataset, which is a dataset that contains the blogs from the Hugging Face website.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

All notebooks for RAG can be found in the [RAG directory](./rag) and all artifacts can be found in the [RAG collection on the Hub](https://huggingface.co/collections/ai-blueprint/retrieval-augemented-generation-rag-6790c9f597b02c043cfbf7af).

# Installation and configuration

## Python environment

We will use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage the project. First create a virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then you can install all the required dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --all-groups
```

Or you can sync between different dependency groups:

```bash
uv sync scraping
uv sync rag
uv sync information-extraction
```

## Hugging Face Account

You will need a Hugging Face account to use the Hub API. You can create one [here](https://huggingface.co/join). After this you can follow the [huggingface-cli instructions](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/installation#huggingface-cli) and log in to configure your Hugging Face token.

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```
